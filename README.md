# digital humanities summer institute 2015

There were a lot of great courses as DHSI this past summer. I spent the large part of June learning and working with digital documentary editions, physical computing and desktop fabrication, programming in R, and topic modelling. I also picked up that Canadians spell "modeling" with the super stylish double. By way of introduction to topic modelling (see what I did?) I played around with word frequency distributions in The Great Gatsby. We did other cool things, but, for now, here's a fragment of code.
